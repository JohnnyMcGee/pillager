# Pillager

Management solutions for the modern Viking:
- create and update "Raid" projects
- track the details of your projects as they change
- assign Vikings from your team and chat about projects


## Under the Hood

Pillager is a vaguely viking-themed social project management app. It authenticates users and performs crud operations on a NoSQL database in the cloud. It uses the following technologies:

- Flutter web (front end application)
- Firebase (back end application)
  - email/pwd authentication
  - cloud firestore database
  - single page app hosting
- BLoC pattern state management (via the [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc "flutter_bloc") package)
